# Real-Time Chat Feature Plan

We will implement a complete real-time messaging system using Supabase websockets to allow students (tenants) and listers to communicate privately.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Database & RLS Setup

1. Create `conversations` table fields (`id`, `student_id`, `lister_id`, `listing_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).
2. Create `messages` table fields (`id`, `conversation_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `read_at`, `created_at`).
3. Set up Foreign Keys mapping to `auth.users` and `listings`.
4. Enable RLS and add policies: users can only read/insert if they are part of the conversation.
5. Enable Supabase Realtime for the `messages` table.

### Phase 2: Hooks & Global State (React Query / Zustand)

1. Create `use-conversations.ts` to fetch all chats for a user (with latest message and unread count).
2. Create `use-messages.ts` for fetching messages of a specific conversation and subscribing to real-time inserts via Supabase `.on('postgres_changes', ...)`.
3. Create a Zustand store `chat-store.ts` to manage global unread counts and track the currently open conversation ID to automatically mark new messages as read.

### Phase 3: Initialization & Entry Points

1. Update listing details (e.g., `listing-card.tsx`) to implement the "Dorm Chat" button.
2. Create server action / mutation `use-init-chat.ts` to create or fetch an existing conversation when "Dorm Chat" is clicked, then redirect to the chat page (`/dashboard/chats/[id]`).

### Phase 4: Global Badges & Layout Integration

#### note

    make sure that the UI makes sense in big and small screens, for example for small screens the badge must show in the burger menu, which when opened, will aslo show a badge on the specific tab that should have the badge

1. Add real-time unread badges to `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` and `components/lister/lister-sidebar.tsx`.
2. Add real-time badges to headers: `student-nav-header.tsx` and `lister-dashboard-header.tsx`.

### Phase 5: Chat UI & Interactivity

1. Build `chat-sidebar.tsx` showing the list of conversations + individual unread counters.
2. Build `chat-window.tsx`: message history, auto-scroll-to-bottom, "typing" indicators.
3. Build `message-input.tsx`: text area with send button, handling optimistic UI updates.
4. Implement automatic `read_at` updating when viewing a chat.

## Relevant Files

- `supabase/migrations/*_chat_tables.sql` — Add tables and RLS policies.
- `app/dashboard/chats/page.tsx` & `app/lister/chats/page.tsx` — Main chat views.
- `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` & `components/lister/lister-sidebar.tsx` — Location of unread badges.
- `hooks/use-messages.ts` — Location for Realtime subscription logic.

## Verification

1. Verify RLS: Ensure student A cannot read student B's conversations in the Supabase logs.
2. Verify Realtime: Open lister and student views side-by-side; send a message and verify it appears instantly on the other side.
3. Verify Badge Logic: Ensure the unread count increases on new messages and resets to 0 when the conversation layout is opened.

## Decisions

- Conversations will be linked to a specific `listing_id` to provide context to the lister on which property the student is asking about.
- Real-time subscriptions will use Supabase Postgres Changes strictly on the `messages` table.
